# Roadmap

Heres what I plan to do, in order.

- [ ] Change class method visibilities
- [ ] Add docs for every kind of "chunk" you can use.
- [ ] Make some "flag" chunks i.e everything between these 2 is optional in and of itself.
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] `start()` and `end()` should only be called once
- [ ] Refactor code:
    - [ ] Get it on Composer/Packagist
